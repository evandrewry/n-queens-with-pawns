                 Challenge Problem
================================================================

This homework doubles as the programming challenge.  All of the required files
and test harness are included in this tarball.

doit.sh: The script we will use to compile and run your code.  Do not modify.

src/: Directory for source files.  See Solver.x10 for the interface to
      solve(), the method you should optimize.  Recall that the problem is to
      place N queens on an NxN board such that none of the queens can kill
      eachother.  You are also given zero or more fixed-position pawns which
      can block queens.  Given a board size and set of pawns, your code should
      return the number of viable queen arrangements.  

To turnin this assignment, rename your Solver.x10 to UNI_Solver.x10 and email
it to Ivan (zw2229@columbia.edu).
